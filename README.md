# WhaleOrFailDiscordBot
A discord bot that returns whether a bundle is a good buy (whale) or not (fail).

This determination is made by converting the components of a bundle into the hard-currency (gem) equivalent and comparing the cost of the bundle to the cost of buying the gems that the bundle is evaluated at. If the bundle has better value than purchasing the gem equivalent directly, it is determined to be worth buying.
