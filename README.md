# WhaleOrFailDiscordBot
A discord bot that returns whether a bundle is a good buy (whale) or not (fail).

This determination is made by converting the components of a bundle into the hard-currency (gem) equivalent and comparing the cost of the bundle to the cost of buying the gems at which the bundle is evaluated. If the bundle has better value than purchasing the gem equivalent directly, it is not a slap in the face.
